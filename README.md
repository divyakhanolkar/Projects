# Project Repository: Data Analytics, Data Science, and Machine Learning

Welcome to my project repository! This repository contains a collection of academic projects focused on **data analytics**, **data science**, **machine learning**, and **predictive analytics**. Each project showcases different aspects of data exploration, analysis, and model building, reflecting various techniques and methodologies learned throughout my academic journey.

## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into several projects, each demonstrating specific concepts:

- **Data Analytics:** Projects that involve data cleaning, exploration, and visualization. These include tasks like statistical analysis, trend identification, and hypothesis testing.

- **Data Science:** Projects that encompass data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of different machine learning algorithms.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Projects focused on building predictive models using Discrete Choice Modelling. These include model training, evaluation, and deployment to analyze behavioral decision-making.

## Project Structure

Each project folder typically includes:

- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Detailed analysis and code, providing step-by-step insights into the data and methodologies used.
- **Scripts:** Python or R scripts used for data processing, modeling, and analysis.
- **Data Files:** Sample datasets provided for some projects.
- **PPT Files:** Presentation slides briefing the approach and results.

## Note on Restricted Projects

For certain projects completed in association with professors, the code and data cannot be disclosed. In these cases, only the presentation slides (PPT) are included to provide an overview of the project objectives, methodologies, and results.
