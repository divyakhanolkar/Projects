# Bankruptcy Prediction

This data-set was obtained here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction

It contains financial indicators about Taiwanese companies (from 1999 to 2009).
Each row contains 95 such indicators and one 0/1 label (binary classification).
The label tells whether or not the company went bankrupt.

## Highlights

* The column names are well-descriptive of the features.
* The data is unbalanced: only around 3% of the companies went bankrupt.
