## Problem Description

As part of a consulting team, you have been tasked with analyzing a large dataset of corporate demand data to gain insights into the characteristics of the product portfolio and the demand situation. The project involves using ABC and XYZ analyses to provide valuable recommendations and visualizations.

   - **Advanced Visualization:** Create visualizations to illustrate the demand characteristics and product portfolio comprehensively. Use additional data if necessary to support your findings (e.g., stock market prices, news).

5. **Recommendations:**
   - **Prepare Recommendations:** Based on the analyses and visualizations, provide actionable recommendations regarding the demand situation and product portfolio management.

By completing these tasks, you will help provide a thorough overview of the companyâ€™s demand situation and make informed recommendations for future strategies.
