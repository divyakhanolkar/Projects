# Project: Data-driven Circular Economy

## Problem Description

The transition from linear to closed-loop supply chains is a significant challenge across various industries. This project focuses on exploring the role of Circular Economy in transforming traditional supply chains into sustainable systems, leveraging digital technologies to enhance efficiency and sustainability in textile industry.

### Objectives

1. **Analyze Recent Challenges and Opportunities:**
   - Present an overview of the recent challenges and opportunities associated with Circular Economy in the textile industry. Highlight key trends and obstacles faced by companies in adopting circular practices.

2. **Examine Supply Chain Challenges:**
   - Detail the specific challenges of implementing Circular Economy principles across different supply chain stages:
     - **Procurement:** Address issues related to sourcing sustainable materials and managing supply chain transparency.
     - **Production:** Discuss difficulties in adapting production processes to support recycling and reuse.
     - **Distribution:** Explore challenges in logistics and distribution for circular models.

3. **Identify Starting Points for Closed Loops:**
   - Brainstorm and present potential starting points for converting linear supply chains into closed loops. Focus on innovative solutions and strategies that can close material, information, and energy loops.

4. **Propose and Detail Your Idea:**
   - Present and elaborate on one specific idea for creating a closed-loop system. Describe the idea in detail, including how it addresses the challenges identified and the benefits it provides.

5. **Role of Digitalization and Technology:**
   - Analyze the role of digitalization, data, digital twins, and other technological advancements in supporting your proposed idea. Discuss how these technologies can enhance the feasibility and effectiveness of the closed-loop system.

6. **Implications for Business Models:**
   - Evaluate the implications of the proposed idea on the business model. Use the Business Model Canvas to assess changes in unique selling propositions (USPs), costs, revenues, and other key aspects of the business.

By addressing these objectives, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the practical application of Circular Economy principles and the impact of digital technologies on supply chain transformation.
